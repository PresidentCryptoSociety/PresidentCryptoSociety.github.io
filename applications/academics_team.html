    <h1>Join the Academics Team!</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        Maybe you’ve just bought your first fraction of Bitcoin on eToro and already view yourself as a BTC-Maxi who will live the decentralized life on Bali; 
        maybe you are way too deep into crypto to tell your family about how deep and you just got rug-pulled by an OHM Dao fork with a funny dog Portrait. 
        Maybe you're also just a normal person, interested in cryptocurrencies and the technology behind them.
        <br><br>
        Either way, nobody knows everything in this rapidly growing space, but you can be a part of exploring it. 
        As Academic Analyst, you will be part of a group dedicated to sharing and spreading knowledge about all kinds of topics in crypto. 
        We will analyze different coins and their tokenomics, understand and use Decentralized Finance on different Blockchains, look into NFT projects and play-2-earn games.
        <br><br>
        As long as you are motivated and bring the ambition to learn about new projects and share this knowledge with others, 
        you will be at the forefront of academic content in the Crypto Society. The position of Academic Analyst comes with the following TAA:
        <br><br>

        tokenomics, NFT's, DeFi, play-2-earn games, underlying technologies and other topics of interest.
        Thereby, you are at the core of the academic content of the Crypto Society.
        <br><br>
        <em class="taa">Authority</em><br>
        You will propose and decide on topics our team should analyze. You will present
        topics to other members of the Society as well as to public audiences at events.
        <br><br>
        <em class="taa">Accountability</em><br>
        As Academic Analyst, you are accountable to the Head of Academic Affairs for the dutiful conduct of your work.
