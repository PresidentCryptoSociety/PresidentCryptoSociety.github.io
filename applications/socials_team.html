        Are you interested in joining the unit that organizes and holds social events? 
        Become a Social Events Co-Manager and participate in the creation and 
        direction of exciting events! You will collaborate with your team members to set in motion events 
        that will help the Crypto Society to grow and flourish. 
        You will further profit from receiving first-hand opportunities of getting to know a rich network 
        of people in the crypto and blockchain industry.
        <br><br>
        The Social Events Team embraces a wide array of practical activities. 
        These will allow you to put into practice the knowledge you have gathered in your studies. 
        Experience what it takes to plan, organize, and collaborate with team members and external partners 
        to set up events serving as a platform of social exchange. These events will be varied and will 
        potentially range from meet and greets to exciting excursions to crypto events, 
        as well as collaborations with crypto-affiliated partners.
        <br><br>
        If all of this sounds exciting to you and you would describe yourself as a motivated and determined team-player, 
        you are very welcome to join our team. The position of Social Events Co-Manager comes with the following TAA:

        Your task will be partly centred around the research of themes, locations, and dates of social events. 
        You will also focus on getting in contact with potential event partners of our club, in the fields of gastronomy, leisure, as well as crypto and blockchain.
        <br><br>
        <em class="taa">Authority</em><br>
        You will propose suggestions regarding themes, locations, and dates for our club’s social events. 
        You may become the Crypto Society’s spokesperson and represent the Crypto Society mostly as “first point of contact” to our event partners.
        <br><br>
        <em class="taa">Accountability</em><br>
        As Social Events Co-Manager, you are accountable to the Head of Social Events for dutiful conduct of your work.
