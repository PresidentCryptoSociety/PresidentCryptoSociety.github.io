        Become a Social Events Co-Manager and participate in the creation and 
        direction of exciting events! You will collaborate with your team members to set in motion events

        You will further profit from receiving first-hand opportunities of getting to know a rich network 
        of people in the crypto and blockchain industry.
        <br><br>
        The Social Events Team embraces a wide array of practical activities.

        Experience what it takes to plan, organize, and collaborate with team members and external partners 
        to set up events serving as a platform of social exchange. These events will be varied and will 
        potentially range from meet and greets to exciting excursions to crypto events, 
        as well as collaborations with crypto-affiliated partners.
        <br><br>
        If all of this sounds exciting to you and you would describe yourself as a motivated and determined team-player, 
        you are very welcome to join our team. The position of Social Events Co-Manager comes with the following TAA:
